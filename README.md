## Features

This app sends a customizable message (via modmail or private chat) automatically whenever a user is unbanned. Mods can also:
- Enable or disable the app at will without needing to uninstall it.
- Choose whether to send as the subreddit via modmail or privately from the bot account (whose inbox is NOT monitored).
- Define a blocklist of mods whose unban actions will not trigger messages.
- Define an allowlist of mods if *only* unban actions from certain mods should trigger messages.
