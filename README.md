## Features

Do you have scheduled megathreads in your community such as daily, weekly, or monthly discussion threads? Would you like to automate the locking of each one of those threads once a newer one replaces it?

This app locks pinned (stickied) posts, such as megathreads, automatically once they are unpinned and bumped off the subreddit highlights.

- Enable or disable the app at will without needing to uninstall it.
- Configure a list of flairs for posts that this app will automatically lock when unpinned.
- Configure a list of title keywords for posts that this app will automatically lock when unpinned.
- Optionally unlock posts when they are pinned (for accidental unpins).
